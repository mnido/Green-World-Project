        <p class="Q">Q: What is Global Warming?</p>
        <p class="A">
          A: Global Warming is the increase of the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. Over the past 50 years, the global
          temperature has increased at the fastest rate recorded in history. According to Nasa, all but one of the hottest 16 years 
          have occurred after 2000.

        <p class="Q"> What causes Global Warming?</p>
        <p class="A"> 
          A: Global Warming is caused by the green house gases such as carbon dioxide and other air pollutants that are collected in 
          the atmosphere. The collected gases allows the Earth to absorb the heat. Having an excess of of the gases causes more heat
          to be trapped rather deflecting it which results in the the planet to get hotter.
          Due to the industrial revolution and human activity, we have been creating more CO2 emissions which helps global warming.
          A big example of human activity resulting in billions of tons of CO2 every year is the burning of fossil fuels to make electricity.

        <p class="Q">What are some of the effects of Global Warming?</p>
        <p class="A">
          A: Some of the effects of global warming are the melting of ice caps which results in rising sea levels. The oceans are also getting warmer 
          and more acidic which affects marine life like corals who can only live in certain temperatures. Marine Wildlife aren't the only animals to
          be hurt by global warming. In general there will be higher wildlife extinction rates due to changes in habitats. There is also more extreme 
          weather such as hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, changing rain and snow patterns.
          <br>
          <br>
          This also affects us and future generations as climate-linked disasters have displaced more than 2 million people. Around 821 million people are
          undernourished due to drought. 35+ million people are affected by floods. Due to rising sea levels flooding in coastal cities is probable and at
          least 17 of the world's largest cities are located along the coast.

          <p class="Q">Q: Where does my country stand in terms of global warming contributors and its laws regarding the issue?</p>
          <p class="A">
            A: Currently, China is in the lead for most carbon emmissions with the US in second place and India in third place. However there is hope
            as 179 countries out of 195 countries are part of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is an environmental accord adopted by mostly
            every nation to address climate change and its negative impacts and how to protect our environment.
